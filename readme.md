Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests before writing the actual implementation code. Here's a set of TDD statements for the movie listing application:

1. Test Case: User Registration
    Scenario 1: User enters a valid email address, name and age.
        Assertion: User should be successfully registered and added to the list of users.
    Scenario 2: User enters an invalid email address (e.g., missing '@' symbol).
        Assertion: Registration should fail, and the user should not be added to the list of users.
    Scenario 3: User enters any value other than integer value in the age field.
        Assertion: Registration should fail, and user should not be added to the list of users.
2. Test Case: Movie Search
    Scenario 1: User searches for a movie title.
        Assertion: All movies matching the title should be returned.
    Scenario 2: User searches for a movie cast.
        Assertion: All movies featuring the specified cast member should be returned.
    Scenario 3: User searches for a movie category.
        Assertion: All movies belonging to the specified category should be returned.
3. Test Case: View Movie Details
    Scenario 1: User enters an existing movie title.
        Assertion: Details of the specified movie should be displayed.
    Scenario 2: User enters a non-existing movie title.
        Assertion: Program should indicate that the movie is not found.
4. Test Case: Add Movie to Favorites
    Scenario 1: User enters a valid email address and an existing movie title.
        Assertion: Movie should be successfully added to the user's favorites.
    Scenario 2: User enters an invalid email address or a non-existing movie title.
        Assertion: Adding movie to favorites should fail.
5. Test Case: Remove Movie from Favorites
    Scenario 1: User enters a valid email address and an existing movie title in favorites.
        Assertion: Movie should be successfully removed from the user's favorites.
    Scenario 2: User enters an invalid email address or a non-existing movie title.
        Assertion: Removing movie from favorites should fail.
6. Test Case: View User Details And Favorites
    Scenario 1: User enters a valid email address.
        Assertion: Program should display user details regarding that user email and all movies in the user's favorites list.
    Scenario 2: User enters an invalid email address.
        Assertion: Program should indicate that the user is not found.
7. Test Case: Search User Favorites
    Scenario 1: User enters a valid email address and a search query.
        Assertion: Program should display only the movies in the user's favorites list that match the search query.
    Scenario 2: User enters an invalid email address.
        Assertion: Program should indicate that the user is not found.
These test cases cover the core functionalities of the movie listing application and ensure that each component behaves as expected.
